Gift Box and Gift Keys are complementary Flutter applications designed to create a secure, digital gifting experience.
Gift Box acts as a secure digital receiver, awaiting the correct authentication signal, while Gift Keys manages the
digital keys used to unlock the gifts via NFC Host Card Emulation (HCE).
Currently, the applications are only supported on **Android**.

You can explore the project through the following directories:

- [Assets](assets):  Contains backup files for Rive animations used for editing and working within the Rive editor.
- [Gift Box](gift_box): Application designed for birthday celebrants to receive and open their digital gifts.
- [Gift Keys](gift_keys): Application allows users to manage digital keys to unlock the Gift Boxes.
